# Functional Draft
***
## Summary
I'll try to create some kind of Roleplay platform using LLMs, but instead of just relying on current character models (and scenary models), more in depth world descriptions will be created and handled, in order to assist the LLMs to create a more easy to understand and easy to follow world and Roleplay experience.

Every interaction won't be just one big message to the Text-gen LLM, but instead, it'll be split in chunks for the different concepts being handled here. This **should** improve consistency in long sessions (new or loaded sessions).

## TODO:
- [ ] Describe current Scene
- [ ] How will be modeles the Activity
***
## Random Ideas. Pending classification.
### Location
The idea here is to be able to create **Locations**, which can be hierarchically linked (sub-location)
These **Locations** will have 
- Physical description: how the place looks like, what does it have/contain
- Social description: if there is any civilization inhabiting the Location, including their political order, beliefs or rules affecting this.
- Activity: What's _happening_ in the **location** in this moment. (This requires more thought and refinement).
- Roles:
    - **Actors**, in the locations, will have a defined Role. This roles can have a description regarding how the avatars fit in the Location.
### Actor
An Actor is a functional being, with their own mind. If these Actors are controlled by a **User**, then they'll be **Avatars**.
If they're controlled by the system, they become **Characters**.
**Actors** have:
- Physical description: how these beings look like.
- **Outfits**: In case the do use outfits, a set of **outfits** that the **Actors** might use. Also, in which _situations_ they might use these outfits. Actors should be able to change their outfits. This seems to require some refinement.
#### Character
A _system_ controlled **Actor**

They should have a defined **behavior**
The **behavior** consists of:
- Personality
- Traits
- Memory
#### Avatar
A **user** controlled **Actor**

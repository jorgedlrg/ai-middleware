# Functional Draft
***
## TODO:
- [ ] Describe current Scene
- [ ] How will be modeles the Activity
***
## Random Ideas. Pending classification.
### Locations
The idea here is to be able to create **Locations**, which can be hierarchically linked (sub-location)
These **Locations** will have 
- Physical description: how the place looks like, what does it have/contain
- Social description: if there is any civilization inhabiting the Location, including their political order, beliefs or rules affecting this.
- Activity: What's happening in the location in this moment. (This requires more thought and refinement).
- Roles:
    - **Actors**, in the locations, will have a defined Role. This roles can have a description regarding how the avatars fit in the Location.
### Actor
An Actor is a functional being, with their own mind. If these Actors are controlled by a **User**, then they'll be **Avatars**.
If they're controlled by the system, they become **Characters**.
**Actors** have:
- Physical description: how these beings look like.
- Outfits: In case the do use outfits, a set of outfits that the Actos might use. Also, in which situations they might use these outfits. This seems to require some refinement.

You're in a fictional roleplay scenario.
This is the scenario description:
[(${scenarioDescription})]

This is the current context, named [(${name})]:
{
    [(${description})]
}

This scenario contains the following actors:
[[# th:each="actor : ${actors}"]
    {
      "name": [(${actor.actorName})],
      "profile": [(${actor.profile})],
      "physical description": [(${actor.physicalDescription})],
      [# th:if="${actor.currentOutfit.present}"]"outfit": [(${actor.currentOutfit.get})],[/]
      [# th:if="${actor.personality.present}"]"personality": [(${actor.personality.get})],[/]
      "role": [(${actor.roleDescription})]
    }
[/]]

This is what the actors have said so far:
[[# th:each="previousMessage : ${previousMessages}"]
    [(${previousMessage.actorName})]: [# th:if="${previousMessage.action.present}"]*[(${previousMessage.action.get})]*[/] [(${previousMessage.speech})]
[/]]

You're playing the actor [(${you})]. 
These are the memories [(${you})] has. Only consider those that are relevant to the current context and events:
[[# th:each="memoryFragment : ${memoryFragments}"]
    [(${memoryFragment.text})]
[/]]

Write BRIEFLY what the actor is thinking at the moment. Do not speak, do not perform any actions, just write the actor thoughts, and you're encouraged to use emojis. And remember, BRIEFLY.

VERY IMPORTANT: write your answer completely in [(${language})].

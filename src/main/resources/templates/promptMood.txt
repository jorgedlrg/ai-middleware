You're in a fictional roleplay scenario.
This is the scenario description:
[(${scenarioDescription})]

This is the current context, named [(${name})]:
{
    [(${description})]
}

This scenario contains the following actors:
[[# th:each="actor : ${actors}"]
    {
      "name": [(${actor.actorName})], 
      "physical description": [(${actor.physicalDescription})]
      [# th:if="${actor.currentOutfit.present}"]
      "outfit": [(${actor.currentOutfit.get})]
      [/]
      [# th:if="${actor.personality.present}"]
      "personality": [(${actor.personality.get})]
      [/]
      "role": [(${actor.roleDescription})]
    }
[/]]

This is what the actors have said so far:
[[# th:each="previousMessage : ${previousMessages}"]
    [(${previousMessage.actorName})]: [(${previousMessage.message})]
[/]]

Given all this information, write in one word the mood of [(${you})] and it's corresponding emoji when they said the last message.

VERY IMPORTANT: write your answer completely in English.

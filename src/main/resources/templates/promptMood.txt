You're in a fictional roleplay scenario.

This is what the actors have said so far:
[[# th:each="previousMessage : ${previousMessages}"]
    [(${previousMessage.actorName})]: [(${previousMessage.message})]
[/]]

Given all this information, write in one word the mood of [(${you})] for the last message.
You can only use one of the following moods: {[[# th:each="mood : ${moods}"] [(${mood.name})], [/]]}

VERY IMPORTANT: write your answer completely in English.

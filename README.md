# ai-middleware
An experimental AI middleware.

The idea here is to create a middleware to connect different AI frontend to AI providers (like chat backends, voice backends, etc) in order to create a Chat experience.

I'll also apply a DDD approach (I'm going to use this project as an exercise).

You can find documentation and info in the ./doc folder, like this [functional draft](/doc/functional_draft.md)
